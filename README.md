Hello!
* My name is Stan Kurkula and I am the CEO of Node STAN Nft. Our team is a community of professional participants in various tests. We've been doing this for over two years now.

There are several departments in our company, such as marketing department, design department, technical department.
We also have a telegram channel with over 4000 subscribers. In this channel, we implement tests of various projects.

We use only high-quality own servers, which we maintain ourselves. Before installing a validator, we always stress test our server for all possible flaws.

Our interest is to help the project test the product and, if possible, get into the mainnet.
We are open to cooperation and ready to fulfill the tasks that will be required of us.
